# FoodShare Platform Implementation

###### *This repository depicts a platform conducted by 2 students of the [Department of Management Science and Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst) (DMST) of the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), for the self-titled assignment implemented in the context of the course "Internet and Cloud Application Development", under the supervision of professor [Mr. Panagiotis Louridas](https://github.com/louridas).*

### *The Project Selection*
Currently we are building our own startup with the aid of the Athens Center of Entrepreunship and Innovation, called "FoodShare". This is why we decided to combine this assignment and start building our platform. In short terms, FoodShare is an incentivised peer-to-peer platform with the ultimate goal of reducing food waste.
